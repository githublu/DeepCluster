# Distributed GPU cluster
## Easy to use and Cheap GPU cluster for deep learning powered by distributed GPUs

It is a fully managed platform allows students and researchers to simply submit their training task to our GPU cluster with only very minimal code changes  
Our GPU cluster is powered by people who would like to share their spare GPU with others  
Designed specifically for students and researchers who wants to do deep learning but do not have convenient access to powerful GPU or GPU cluster.  
Users can just focus on their code instead of execution enviornment.

## Using it is very simple
We provide a [template repo](https://github.com/githublu/DDLTemplate) for submit your training task.  
You just need to invoke your training fucntion in the template and submit your task

## Use our known datasets or upload your own dataset for training
There are a large number of open source datasets can be used for training. We provide a list popular datasets that you can choose from to train your model.  
You can also upload your own dataset and consume it in similar fashion. With one caveat, [please use public or nonsensitive dataset](#We-secure-your-code-but-use-nonsensitive-dataset)

## We secure your code but use nonsensitive dataset
Each training job is preprocessed so that GPU host cannot steal your code, however, data has to be unencrypted at the time of computation due to performance considerations. So, please use public or nonsensitive dataset since GPU host could be curious about what data you are using
