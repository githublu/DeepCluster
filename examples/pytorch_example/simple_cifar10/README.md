A simple example to run cifar10 on pytorch using our precached dataset
this example shows how to wrap training function to be ready for running experiment
Code is borrowed from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html
and run on GPU to fully utilize the benefits of DeepCluster
